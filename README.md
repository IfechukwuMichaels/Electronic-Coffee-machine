# Electronic-Coffee-machine
This is the code of an e-coffee machine that can take any of 4 possible inputs (report, espresso, latte, or cappuccino). The report input is reserved for the machine owner.
The machine does the following after an input has been selected:

1. Check to ensure there is enough ingredients to make selected coffee type.
2. Requests for payment and checks to ensure the buyer has put in enough money.
3. If the above two conditions are met, 
  - It dispenses the ordered coffee type.
  - Calculates the change to be given back to the buyer.
  - Recalculates the quantity of ingredients (water, coffee, milk) left after dispensing.
  - Recalculate the money from sales.

This code utilises data types (boolean, integers, strings), data structures (dictionary), functions, global and local variables, while loop, if statement, operators, and accumulators.
